# Contributing to Stratovate Solutions Projects

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our projects! This guide will help you get started with contributing to any repository in the Stratovate Solutions organization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account
- Node.js/npm or Python/pip (depending on the project)
- PowerShell (for Windows-specific projects)

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Develop**: Make your changes following our coding standards
4. **Test**: Run tests and ensure everything works
5. **Commit**: Use conventional commit messages
6. **Push**: Push your branch to your fork
7. **PR**: Create a pull request with our template

## 📝 Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```text
feat(auth): add single sign-on support
fix(api): resolve timeout issues in user endpoint
docs: update installation instructions
chore(deps): bump lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21
```

## 🏗️ Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features (if used)
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

## 🧪 Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include integration tests where appropriate

### Running Tests

```bash
# Node.js projects
npm test

# Python projects
pytest

# PowerShell projects
Invoke-Pester
```

## 📊 Code Quality

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use Black/Flake8 for Python
- Use PSScriptAnalyzer for PowerShell

### Code Review

- All changes require code review
- Address reviewer feedback promptly
- Ensure CI/CD checks pass
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

## 🔒 Security
